Team MINSensory aims to provide a complete interface suite that will allow for real-time collection, analysis, and visualization of neural signals. Using the newly developed Multiple-Input Neural Sensor Integrated Circuit (MINS IC), an array of 16x16 neural signals can be captured at high fidelity and processed through a hardware and software interface. This interface will consist of a daughter board for real time collection and analysis as well as a software suite to visualize and store incoming data for users. The hardware interface consists of a custom designed PCB allowing for capture and processing of analog signals using digital signal processing techniques that yield fast analysis on the data. The software interface will include both a color-mapped grid, displaying the relative intensity of all 256 nodes, as well as five user- selectable waveform plots of voltage vs. time. Along with providing real-time visualizations, this system will also provide real-time activity recognition in the form of neural band identification. This combination of high fidelity neural sensing, real-time activity recognition, and real-time visualizations will provide researchers with unprecedented control and depth in their neural experimentation and will expand avenues for neural research.
